## How to use it
### Block and Flight Time Calculator
- Enter times in 24 hour format, **without** any colon separator, then tap `Calculate Total`.
- Times entered as less than four digits **are** calculable.
- NO check is made on the validity of entered data; take care and check the resulting output.
- Results are displayed in the format "hh:mm ~ hh.h".

### Jet A-1 Fuel Calculator
The Fuel Calculator auto-updates the resulting difference between any entered Begin and End values, as they are entered. Simultaneously, a conversion
of the result value _in pounds (lb)_ is displayed as both litres (lb / 1.76) and US gallons (lb / 6.7) - occasionally useful info to communicate to a refuelling tanker driver for their planning purposes.
